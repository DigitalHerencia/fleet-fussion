# FleetFusion Domain Architecture Audit & Development Prompts

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive audit of the FleetFusion multi-tenant fleet management
system's domain architecture and detailed development prompts for external LLM agents to continue
implementation work.

**Project Context:**

- Multi-tenant SaaS fleet management platform
- Built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Clerk Auth
- RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) with 6 user roles
- Tenant-isolated routing under `app/(tenant)/[orgId]/`

## Architecture Foundation

### Database Schema (Prisma)

The system uses a comprehensive PostgreSQL schema with the following key models:

- `Organization` - Multi-tenant isolation
- `User` - User management with RBAC
- `Driver` - Driver profiles and compliance
- `Vehicle` - Fleet vehicle management
- `Load` - Dispatch and load management
- `ComplianceDocument` - Document management
- `IftaReport`, `IftaTrip`, `IftaFuelPurchase` - IFTA reporting
- `ComplianceAlert` - Compliance monitoring
- `AuditLog` - System audit trail

### RBAC System

**User Roles:**

- `admin` - Full system access
- `dispatcher` - Load and driver management
- `driver` - Limited self-service access
- `compliance_officer` - Compliance oversight
- `accountant` - Financial and IFTA access
- `viewer` - Read-only access

**Permission Structure:**

- Action-based: `create`, `read`, `update`, `delete`, `manage`, `assign`, `approve`, `report`
- Resource-based: `user`, `driver`, `vehicle`, `load`, `document`, `ifta_report`, `organization`,
  `billing`

### Multi-Tenant Routing

- Protected routes under `app/(tenant)/[orgId]/`
- Middleware-enforced organization isolation
- Route-level RBAC protection via `RouteProtection.canAccessRoute()`

## DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES

### Phase 1: Critical Missing Components (Weeks 1-2)

1. **Admin Domain Creation** - Create missing page route and complete administration
2. **Settings Domain Completion** - Finish essential configuration management

### Phase 2: Feature Completion (Weeks 3-4)

3. **Compliance Domain Enhancement** - Complete document upload and automation
4. **Analytics Domain Enhancement** - Add export and real-time features

### Phase 3: Integration and Polish (Weeks 5-6)

5. **Cross-Domain Integration** - Unified navigation and data integration
6. **Performance Optimization** - System-wide improvements
7. **Testing and Quality Assurance** - Comprehensive testing suite

## TECHNICAL GUIDELINES FOR ALL DOMAINS

### Code Quality Standards

- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Comprehensive error handling
- Proper loading and error states
- Responsive design implementation
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### Security Requirements

- RBAC enforcement on all routes
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection

### Performance Standards

- Server-side rendering for initial page loads
- Client-side caching for frequently accessed data
- Optimized database queries with proper indexing
- Image optimization and lazy loading
- Bundle size optimization

### Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for all server actions
- Integration tests for critical workflows
- E2E tests for user journeys
- Permission testing for RBAC compliance
- Performance testing for large datasets
