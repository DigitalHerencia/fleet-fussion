## Architecture Foundation

### Database Schema (Prisma)

The system uses a comprehensive PostgreSQL schema with the following key models:

- `Organization` - Multi-tenant isolation
- `User` - User management with RBAC
- `Driver` - Driver profiles and compliance
- `Vehicle` - Fleet vehicle management
- `Load` - Dispatch and load management
- `ComplianceDocument` - Document management
- `IftaReport`, `IftaTrip`, `IftaFuelPurchase` - IFTA reporting
- `ComplianceAlert` - Compliance monitoring
- `AuditLog` - System audit trail

### RBAC System

**User Roles:**

- `admin` - Full system access
- `dispatcher` - Load and driver management
- `driver` - Limited self-service access
- `compliance_officer` - Compliance oversight
- `accountant` - Financial and IFTA access
- `viewer` - Read-only access

**Permission Structure:**

- Action-based: `create`, `read`, `update`, `delete`, `manage`, `assign`, `approve`, `report`
- Resource-based: `user`, `driver`, `vehicle`, `load`, `document`, `ifta_report`, `organization`,
  `billing`

### Multi-Tenant Routing

- Protected routes under `app/(tenant)/[orgId]/`
- Middleware-enforced organization isolation
- Route-level RBAC protection via `RouteProtection.canAccessRoute()`
