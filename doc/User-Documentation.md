# Admin Guide

## Overview

Administrators (Admins) have full access to FleetFusion and oversee the entire fleet management
system for their company. An Admin is typically responsible for initial system setup, managing users
and roles, and configuring company-wide settings.

## Key Responsibilities

- **User Management:** Invite new users, assign roles (Dispatcher, Driver, Compliance Officer), and
  remove or update users as needed.
- **Company Settings:** Update company profile information and preferences (such as company details,
  branding, or default settings).
- **Access & Permissions:** Ensure each team member has appropriate access; only Admins can grant
  roles or change other users’ roles.
- **Oversight:** View system audit logs and activities to monitor usage and security. Admins may
  also handle high-level tasks like managing billing or subscriptions if applicable.

## Guide

**Inviting a New User:**

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Users & Roles** in the FleetFusion dashboard.
2. Click **Invite User**.
3. Enter the user's email address and select the appropriate role (e.g., Dispatcher, Driver,
   Compliance Officer).
4. Send the invitation. The invited user will receive an email with instructions to join your
   organization.

**Managing Company Information:**

1. Go to **Settings** > **Company Profile** (or **Company Settings**).
2. Update any necessary fields such as company name, address, contact information, or preferences
   (e.g., time zone, unit settings).
3. Click **Save** to apply changes. These settings apply to all users in your organization.

**Reviewing Audit Logs (if available):**

- If FleetFusion provides an **Audit Logs** or **Activity** section (usually under **Settings** or
  an Admin dashboard), navigate there to review recent actions in the system (e.g., user logins,
  data changes).
- Use audit logs to troubleshoot or ensure compliance with internal policies by seeing who did what
  and when.

**Billing Management:**

- If your organization’s plan or billing info is managed through FleetFusion, an Admin can access
  the **Billing** section (often under **Settings**).
- Review subscription details, update payment information, or download invoices as needed. _(If
  billing is not handled in-app, this section may direct you to a separate billing portal or require
  contacting FleetFusion support.)_

## Tips

- Only assign the **Admin** role to trusted users who require full access. Admins can make
  system-wide changes.
- Regularly review the list of users and their roles in **Settings** to ensure permissions are
  up-to-date with any staffing changes.
- Use the [Settings Guide](../MODULE_GUIDES/settings.md) for detailed information on configuration
  options and managing users and roles.

# Dispatcher Guide

## Overview

Dispatchers coordinate and schedule the fleet’s operations. In FleetFusion, a dispatcher primarily
uses the Dispatch module to create and manage loads, assign drivers and vehicles, and monitor
delivery statuses in real-time.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Load Planning:** Create new loads/orders that need to be transported.
- **Driver & Vehicle Assignment:** Assign available drivers and appropriate vehicles to each load.
- **Schedule Management:** Set pickup and delivery times and adjust schedules as necessary.
- **Status Monitoring:** Track the progress of active loads and update statuses or reassign
  resources if issues arise.
- **Communication:** Relay information to drivers regarding their assignments (via internal notes or
  external communication, as needed).

## Guide

**Creating and Assigning a Load:**

1. Navigate to the **Dispatch** module from the dashboard.
2. Click **New Load** to create a load.
3. Enter load details such as origin, destination, cargo description, and pickup/delivery times.
4. Assign a driver and a vehicle to the load from the available dropdown lists of drivers and
   vehicles.
5. Save the load. It will now appear on the dispatch board or list with its initial status (e.g.,
   "Scheduled" or "Pending").

**Managing Active Loads:**

- Monitor the Dispatch dashboard for status updates (e.g., when a driver marks a load as picked up
  or delivered).
- If a driver is unable to complete a load or if schedule changes occur, use the dispatch interface
  to edit the load:

  - Update the load’s details or timing.
  - Reassign the load to a different driver or vehicle if necessary (Tip: in some views you can drag
    and drop a load to a new assignment or use an **Edit** dialog to change the driver/vehicle).

**Adjusting Schedules:**

- For any delays or early completions, update the load's record:

  - Change the delivery or pickup times as needed.
  - Add notes to the load (if the system allows) to inform others of changes or special
    instructions.

- Ensure that drivers are informed of any schedule changes (the system might send notifications, but
  a direct call or message can be used for urgent changes).

## Tips

- Use filtering options in the Dispatch module to quickly find loads by status, driver, date, or
  destination, especially as the number of loads grows.
- Pay attention to color-coding or status labels on the dispatch board (for example, overdue loads
  might be highlighted).
- Refer to the [Dispatch Management Guide](../MODULE_GUIDES/dispatch.md) for detailed instructions
  on using the dispatch interface and features.

# Driver Guide

## Overview

Drivers use FleetFusion to stay informed about their assignments and to record important information
during their trips. A Driver user can see their dispatches, update load statuses, and manage their
own compliance tasks like hours-of-service logs or document uploads.

## Key Responsibilities

- **View Assignments:** Check upcoming and current loads assigned to them, including details like
  addresses, schedules, and instructions.
- **Status Updates:** Mark loads as in-progress (e.g., picked up) or completed (delivered) as they
  carry out deliveries.
- **Document Uploads:** Upload necessary documents such as Proof of Delivery (POD) receipts, fuel
  receipts, or inspection reports related to their trips.
- **Hours of Service (HOS) Logging:** Record driving hours and breaks if the platform supports HOS
  tracking, to comply with regulations.

## Guide

**Viewing and Managing Loads:**

1. Log in to FleetFusion. The dashboard will display your current and upcoming assignments (loads).
2. Click on a load to view its details, including origin/destination, scheduled times, and any notes
   or special instructions.
3. Update the load status as you progress:

   - When you depart for pickup, mark the load as **In Transit** or similar.
   - Upon delivery, mark the load as **Delivered** or **Completed**.
   - These updates inform dispatchers and the system of real-time progress.

**Uploading Documents (e.g., Proof of Delivery):**

1. After completing a load (or as required), you may need to upload a document. In the load details
   page, look for an option to **Upload Document** (or specifically **Upload POD**).
2. Select the file from your device (for example, a signed delivery receipt or a photo of the
   delivered goods).
3. Choose the document type if prompted (e.g., "Proof of Delivery") and add any notes required.
4. Submit the upload. The document will be attached to the load record for dispatchers and
   compliance officers to review.

**Logging Hours (if applicable):**

- If FleetFusion provides an HOS logging feature, access it via the **Compliance** or **Logs**
  section in your dashboard.
- Record your duty status changes (e.g., Driving, On Duty, Off Duty) with start and stop times as
  required by HOS rules.
- Always keep these logs up to date. If the system is connected to an ELD device, some logs might
  auto-populate, but you may need to certify or adjust them.

## Tips

- Keep your assigned load information up to date. Timely status updates help dispatchers respond
  quickly to any delays or issues.
- If using a mobile device, take advantage of FleetFusion’s mobile-friendly interface (if available)
  to update statuses and upload documents on the go.
- If you encounter any issues with your assignment details or the app (e.g., you can’t update a
  status), contact your dispatcher or Admin for assistance.

# Compliance Officer Guide

## Overview

Compliance officers focus on ensuring that all fleet operations meet regulatory requirements. In
FleetFusion, a Compliance Officer uses the platform to track and manage all compliance-related
documents and records, keeping the company ready for inspections or audits at any time.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Document Management:** Ensure that all required documents (driver licenses, medical
  certificates, vehicle inspection reports, insurance policies, etc.) are stored in the system and
  kept up to date.
- **Monitoring Expirations:** Regularly review document statuses and receive alerts for any that are
  expiring soon or have expired.
- **Regulatory Reporting:** Prepare for audits by retrieving necessary records and, if available,
  generate compliance reports for authorities (e.g., a list of expired items, IFTA reports).
- **Policy Enforcement:** Oversee that drivers and other staff are following safety and compliance
  protocols (for example, drivers logging hours properly or vehicles undergoing scheduled
  inspections).

## Guide

**Uploading and Updating Compliance Documents:**

1. Go to the **Compliance** module on the dashboard. You will see an overview list of compliance
   documents and their status (Active, Expiring Soon, Expired).
2. To add a new document (for example, a renewed driver's license or updated insurance card), click
   **Upload Document**.
3. Choose the document type from the list (such as _Driver’s License_, _Insurance_, _Inspection
   Report_, etc.).
4. Enter the required details (e.g., expiration date, associated driver or vehicle) and attach the
   document file.
5. Submit to save. The document will now appear in the list, and its status will be tracked
   automatically based on the expiration date you provided.

**Reviewing Compliance Status:**

- On the main Compliance dashboard, check for any items marked **Expiring Soon** or **Expired**
  (these are usually highlighted or filtered to grab your attention).
- Click on those items to view details and determine what action is needed:

  - If a driver’s license is expiring, reach out to that driver to get an updated license and upload
    it.
  - If a vehicle inspection is expired, schedule an inspection and update the record once completed.

- You can use filters or search in the Compliance module to find specific documents by type (e.g.,
  show all insurance policies) or by personnel/vehicle.

**Preparing for Audits:**

- If an audit or inspection is upcoming, use FleetFusion to retrieve all necessary documentation:

  - Ensure all driver qualification files are present (licenses, medical cards).
  - Ensure all vehicle records are in order (recent inspections, maintenance logs).
  - Export or print documents if needed. (If FleetFusion offers a report or export feature, use it
    to generate a bundle of compliance documents or a report of compliance status).

- Review the **Audit Log** (if provided in the system) to see a history of compliance-related
  actions (e.g., document uploads, edits) in case an auditor inquires about changes or updates.

## Tips

- Schedule a periodic review (e.g., weekly or monthly) of the Compliance module to catch upcoming
  expirations well in advance.
- Communicate with drivers and the fleet manager proactively when documents need renewal.
  FleetFusion’s **Expiring Soon** status is a helpful alert, but direct communication ensures
  everyone is aware.
- Refer to the [Compliance Management Guide](../MODULE_GUIDES/compliance.md) for detailed features
  of the Compliance module and instructions on using its tools effectively.

  data (FleetFusion might allow you to click through to see the related records, or you may use the
  Dispatch/IFTA modules for deeper analysis).

# Settings Guide

## Overview

Manage company information, system preferences, and user roles in the Settings module.

## Key Features

- Update company profile details (name, address, contact info)
- Set preferences like time zone, units of measurement, or notification settings
- Manage users and roles (invite users, assign roles, deactivate accounts)

## How to Use

1. Go to the **Settings** module from the dashboard. You will see sub-sections or tabs for different
   categories (Company Info, Users & Roles, Preferences, etc.).
2. **Company Info:** Review and edit your company’s details. Update fields such as company name,
   address, phone number, logo (if applicable), then save changes.
3. **Users & Roles:** Manage your team’s access:

   - View the list of all users in your organization and their roles.
   - To invite a new user, click **Invite User** and follow the steps (enter email, assign role).

   - Set your time zone and regional settings so that dates/times and units (miles vs. kilometers,
     gallons vs. liters) are tailored to your region.
   - Configure notification preferences (for example, which email notifications or alerts are
     enabled for load assignments, document expirations, etc.).
   - If available, adjust branding settings like uploading a company logo or choosing a theme color
     for the interface.

## Tips

- Only Admins can access and change Settings. If you are not an Admin and need a change, contact
  your Admin.
- Keep the company profile updated, as this information might appear on reports or notifications
  (for instance, the company name and address on IFTA reports).
- When inviting users, double-check the email address and role. New users will only have access to
  what their role permits, so assign roles carefully based on job function. (See the Admin Guide for
  more about roles and permissions.)
