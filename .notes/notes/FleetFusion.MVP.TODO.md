    * Define tables for `companies`, `users`, `roles`, `permissions`, `vehicles`, `drivers`, `loads`, `documents`, `settings`, `subscriptions`, `audit_logs`, etc.
    * Ensure relationships between tables are correctly defined (e.g., a `company` has many `users`, a `user` has one `role`).
* **Configure Drizzle Kit** for migrations in `drizzle.config.ts`.
* **Set up Neon PostgreSQL** as the database provider.
    * Store connection string securely in environment variables.

    * Style forms, buttons, tables, and other common UI elements.
* **Set up Tailwind CSS 4** according to the new CSS-first theming approach:
    * Define design tokens (CSS custom properties for colors, spacing, radius, etc.) in `app/globals.css` within `:root`.
    * Use `hsl(var(--token))` for colors in Tailwind utility classes.
    * Ensure `darkMode: 'class'` is enabled in `tailwind.config.ts`.
* **Create initial pages** for key areas:
    * Public: Landing, About, Pricing, Contact
    * Auth: Sign In, Sign Up
    * App (Protected): Dashboard, Settings

    *   **Fetchers (`lib/fetchers/settingsFetchers.ts`):**
        *   `getUserSettings(userId, orgId)`
        *   `getOrganizationSettings(orgId)`
    *   **Types & Validations (`types/settings.ts`, `validations/settings.ts`):**
        *   Define types for various settings objects.
        *   Zod schemas for settings forms.

*   **Admin-Specific Features (Aligns with `Admin` Domain - Placeholder for MVP):**
    *   **Architectural Overview:** Features for super-admins or high-level system administration, potentially spanning across tenants or managing system-wide configurations.
    *   **Potential MVP Scope (if any, might be deferred):**
        *   Viewing system audit logs (if `audit_logs` table is actively used).
        *   Managing feature flags or system-wide announcements (if applicable).
        *   For a multi-tenant SaaS, this might involve tenant lifecycle management if not fully automated by Clerk/Stripe.
    *   **Note:** For MVP, most "admin" functions will likely be tenant-admin focused and covered within other domains like User Management or Company Management. This is a placeholder for future expansion or if specific system-level admin tasks are identified for MVP.


### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Advanced Features & Integrations:**

*   **Subscription & Billing:**
    *   Integrate Stripe for subscription management (free, pro, enterprise tiers).
    *   Implement logic to restrict features based on subscription tier.
*   **Real-time Tracking (Optional):**
    *   Integrate with ELD/GPS providers for real-time vehicle tracking.
*   **Accounting Integration (Optional):**

*   **Reporting Module:**
    *   Generate custom reports for various aspects of the TMS.
*   **Notifications:**
    *   Implement in-app and email notifications for important events (e.g., new load assignment, expiring documents).

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Testing, Deployment & Polish:**

*   **Write unit and integration tests** for critical business logic (Server Actions, fetchers, utilities).
*   **Implement end-to-end tests** for key user flows.
*   **Set up CI/CD pipeline** for automated testing and deployment (e.g., using Vercel, GitHub Actions).
*   **Optimize for performance and scalability.**
*   **Thoroughly test ABAC rules** to ensure data security and isolation.
*   **Refine UI/UX** based on user feedback.
*   **Create comprehensive documentation** (user guides, API docs).

---

## üìù **Notes & Reminders:**

*   Prioritize server-first rendering with React Server Components (RSC).
*   Use Server Actions for all mutations and form submissions.
*   Keep API routes (`/app/api/*`) minimal (auth, webhooks, 3rd-party integrations).
*   Follow TypeScript best practices (strict mode, `satisfies` for configs).
*   Maintain a clean and modular codebase.
*   Document everything!

# Vercel Deployment Analysis: ABAC Multi-Tenant SaaS with Clerk & Neon

## Current Implementation Assessment

### ‚úÖ What's Working Well

1. **Authentication Architecture**
   - Proper Clerk middleware implementation with ABAC support
   - Comprehensive role-based access control (8 roles: admin, manager, user, dispatcher, driver, compliance, accountant, viewer)
   - Multi-tenant organization structure
   - Proper session claim management

2. **Database Integration**
   - Neon PostgreSQL integration for multi-tenancy
   - Webhook handlers for Clerk-to-database synchronization
   - Proper user metadata and organization metadata handling

3. **Type Safety**
   - Comprehensive TypeScript definitions for auth, ABAC, and permissions
   - Proper typing for Clerk session claims and user context

## Potential Vercel Deployment Issues

### üö® Common Issues & Solutions

#### 1. Environment Variables
**Issue**: Missing or incorrect environment variables in Vercel
**Solution**: Ensure these are set in Vercel dashboard:

```bash
# Clerk Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# Clerk URLs (for production)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_FORCE_REDIRECT_URL=/dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_FORCE_REDIRECT_URL=/onboarding

# Neon Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://...
POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL=postgresql://...
POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING=postgresql://...

# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
```

#### 2. Webhook Configuration
**Issue**: Clerk webhooks failing to reach Vercel deployment
**Solutions**:

1. **Update Clerk Dashboard**:
   - Webhook URL: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/clerk/webhook-handler`
   - Events to listen for: user.created, user.updated, user.deleted, organization.*, organizationMembership.*

2. **Verify Webhook Secret**:
   - Copy webhook secret from Clerk dashboard
   - Add to Vercel environment variables as `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

#### 3. Database Connection Issues
**Issue**: Neon database connection timeouts or connection limits
**Solutions**:

1. **Connection Pooling**:
   - Use `@neondatabase/serverless` (already in package.json ‚úÖ)
   - Implement proper connection management

2. **Database URL Configuration**:
   ```typescript
   // lib/database/connection.ts
   import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
   
   export const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL!);
   ```

#### 4. Middleware Edge Runtime Issues
**Issue**: Middleware not working properly on Vercel Edge Runtime
**Current Status**: Your middleware.ts looks correct ‚úÖ

**Potential Enhancement**:
```typescript
// Add to middleware.ts if experiencing issues
export const config = {
  matcher: [
    '/((?!.+\\.[\\w]+$|_next).*)',
    '/',
    '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
  ],
  runtime: 'nodejs', // Add this if edge runtime causes issues
};
```

#### 5. Server Actions Configuration
**Issue**: Server actions not working in production
**Current Status**: Your next.config.ts has correct allowedOrigins ‚úÖ

**Update for Production**:
```typescript
// next.config.ts
experimental: {
  serverActions: {
    allowedOrigins: [
      'localhost:3000',
      'your-app.vercel.app', // Update this to your actual domain
      '*.vercel.app'
    ],
  },
},
```

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment

- [ ] Update `allowedOrigins` in next.config.ts with production domain
- [ ] Verify all environment variables are set in Vercel
- [ ] Test webhook endpoint locally with ngrok
- [ ] Verify database migrations are applied

### Clerk Configuration

- [ ] Update Clerk authorized redirect URLs
- [ ] Configure webhook endpoint URL in Clerk dashboard
- [ ] Set correct environment (development vs production)
- [ ] Verify session token customization

### Neon Database

- [ ] Verify database connection string format
- [ ] Check connection limits and pooling
- [ ] Ensure proper SSL configuration
- [ ] Verify database schema is up to date

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Vercel Function Logs
Monitor these endpoints for errors:
- `/api/clerk/webhook-handler` - Webhook processing
- Middleware execution logs
- Database connection errors

### Common Error Patterns

1. **Webhook 401 Errors**: Invalid webhook secret
2. **Database Connection Timeouts**: Connection pool exhaustion
3. **Session Claim Errors**: Clerk metadata not synced
4. **Permission Denied**: ABAC rules not properly configured

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Database Queries
```typescript
// Optimize user context queries
export async function getUserWithPermissions(clerkId: string) {
  return await db.query.users.findFirst({
    where: eq(users.clerkId, clerkId),
    with: {
      organization: {
        columns: {
          id: true,
          name: true,
          metadata: true,
        },
      },
    },
  });
}
```

### 2. Session Management
```typescript
// Cache session data to reduce database calls
export function useUserContext(): UserContext | null {
  const { user } = useAuth();
  
  // Consider implementing caching strategy
  return useMemo(() => user, [user]);
}
```

### 3. Middleware Optimization
```typescript
// Add response caching for public routes
if (isPublicRoute(req)) {
  const response = NextResponse.next();
  response.headers.set('Cache-Control', 'public, max-age=3600');
  return response;
}
```

## Security Considerations

### 1. Session Token Security
- Verify session token customization includes necessary claims
- Implement proper token validation in middleware
- Use secure cookie settings

### 2. ABAC Implementation
- Verify permission checks are comprehensive
- Implement proper resource-level authorization
- Add audit logging for permission changes

### 3. Database Security
- Use parameterized queries (Drizzle ORM handles this ‚úÖ)
- Implement proper row-level security
- Verify connection string security

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

2. **Test Authentication Flow**:
   - User registration/login
   - Organization creation/joining
   - Role assignments
   - Permission enforcement

3. **Monitor Webhooks**:
   - Check Vercel function logs
   - Verify database synchronization
   - Test with Clerk dashboard

4. **Performance Testing**:
   - Load test authentication endpoints
   - Monitor database connection usage
   - Verify middleware performance

## Troubleshooting Commands

```bash
# Check Vercel deployment logs
vercel logs

# Test webhook locally
curl -X POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/clerk/webhook-handler \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": true}'

# Verify environment variables
vercel env ls
```

This analysis covers the key areas that typically cause issues when deploying Clerk + Neon multi-tenant applications to Vercel. Your implementation appears solid, so the issues are likely configuration-related.
