# FleetFusion RBAC Deduplication and Restructuring Audit

Here is a detailed evaluation of the codebase for duplicate files, unintentional redundancy, and
opportunities for restructuring to meet modern professional standards. This audit is based on your
projectâ€™s structure, conventions, and the files referenced in your documentation and code.

---

## 1. **Duplicate & Redundant Files**

### **Findings**

#### **a. Auth Logic**

- **Potential Duplicates:**
  - auth.ts and auth.ts
    - Both files appear to handle user/org context and Clerk integration.
    - **Action:** Review and consolidate into a single auth.ts or `lib/auth/clerk.ts` file. Remove
      the less comprehensive or outdated one.

#### **b. Type Definitions**

- **Potential Duplicates:**
  - auth.ts, abac.ts, and possibly auth.ts
    - Overlap in user/org/role/permission types and Zod schemas.
    - **Action:**
      - Move all type definitions to auth.ts and abac.ts (split by domain: auth vs. permissions).
      - Keep Zod schemas in auth.ts only.
      - Remove any duplicate type definitions in auth.ts.

#### **c. Permission Logic**

- **Potential Duplicates:**
  - permissions.ts and any permission logic in auth.ts or auth.ts
    - **Action:**
      - Centralize all permission logic in permissions.ts.
      - Remove permission-related code from other files.

#### **d. Onboarding Actions**

- **Potential Duplicates:**
  - onboardingActions.ts and any onboarding logic in auth.ts or auth.ts
    - **Action:**
      - Keep onboarding logic in onboardingActions.ts only.
      - Remove onboarding code from other files.

#### **e. Navigation Components**

- **Potential Duplicates:**
  - main-nav.tsx and any similar navigation components in components or features
    - **Action:**
      - Ensure there is only one main navigation component.
      - Remove or merge any redundant sidebar/nav components.

#### **f. Middleware**

- **Potential Duplicates:**
  - Only one middleware.ts should exist at the root.
    - **Action:**
      - Delete any middleware.ts or similar files in subdirectories.

---

## 2. **Unintentional Redundancy**

### **Findings**

- **Multiple Fetchers/Actions for the Same Domain:**

  - Check fetchers and actions for functions that fetch or mutate the same resource (e.g., users,
    vehicles, organizations).
  - **Action:**
    - Consolidate fetchers/actions by domain (e.g., `lib/fetchers/vehicles.ts`,
      `lib/actions/vehicles.ts`).
    - Remove any duplicate or unused fetchers/actions.

- **Styles:**

  - Ensure Tailwind config and global styles are only defined in `styles/` and not duplicated in
    component files.
  - **Action:**
    - Remove any inline or duplicate style definitions.

- **Documentation:**
  - Remove outdated or duplicate documentation files in doc or notes that are superseded by newer
    docs.

/app
  /api
    /clerk
      webhook-handler/route.ts
  /[tenant]/[orgId]/

    main-nav.tsx
    sidebar-link.tsx
/features
  /onboarding
    OnboardingForm.tsx
/lib
  auth.ts
  /auth
    clerk.ts
    permissions.ts
  /actions
    onboardingActions.ts
  /fetchers
    vehicles.ts
    users.ts
    ...
/types

## 4. **Files to Delete or Merge**

| File/Folder                           | Action/Reason                                                   |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| auth.ts                               | Merge into auth.ts or `lib/auth/clerk.ts` and delete this file. |
| Duplicate type definitions in auth.ts | Remove; keep types in types, schemas in schemas.                |
| Permission logic in auth.ts           | Move to permissions.ts and remove from auth.ts.                 |
| Onboarding logic in auth.ts           | Move to onboardingActions.ts and remove from auth.ts.           |
| Redundant navigation components       | Remove/merge into main-nav.tsx.                                 |
| Any middleware.ts outside root        | Delete; only keep root-level middleware.ts.                     |
| Duplicate fetchers/actions            | Remove; keep one per domain in fetchers and actions.            |
| Outdated docs in notes                | Remove if superseded by Developer-Documentation.md.             |

## 5. **Migration/Restructuring Steps**

1. **Consolidate Auth Logic:**
   - Merge auth.ts into auth.ts or `lib/auth/clerk.ts`.
2. **Centralize Types and Schemas:**
   - Move all types to types, all Zod schemas to schemas.
3. **Centralize Permissions:**
   - All permission logic in permissions.ts.
4. **Consolidate Onboarding:**
   - All onboarding logic in onboardingActions.ts.
5. **Streamline Navigation:**
   - Only one main navigation component in shared.
6. **Remove Redundant Files:**
   - Delete all identified duplicates and outdated files.
7. **Update Imports:**
   - Refactor imports throughout the codebase to use the new structure.
8. **Document Structure:**
   - Update Developer-Documentation.md to reflect the new organization.

## 6. **Summary Table: Actions**

| Area        | File(s) to Remove/Merge     | New Location/Action                       |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |

| Types       | Duplicates in auth.ts       | Keep only in types                        |
| Permissions | Permission logic in auth.ts | Move to permissions.ts                    |
| Onboarding  | Onboarding logic in auth.ts | Move to onboardingActions.ts              |
| Navigation  | Redundant nav components    | Keep only main-nav.tsx                    |
| Middleware  | Any non-root middleware.ts  | Delete                                    |
| Fetchers    | Duplicate fetchers/actions  | Consolidate by domain                     |
| Docs        | Outdated/duplicate docs     | Keep only latest in doc                   |

## 7. **Final Recommendations**

- **Perform the above migrations and deletions.**
- **Run a full test suite and manual QA after restructuring.**
- **Keep documentation up to date with the new structure.**
- **Adopt this structure for all new features to maintain consistency.**
